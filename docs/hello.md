# Glanceables Project Overview

## Introduction

- **Purpose**: Turns parts of websites into Glanceable widgets, helping you keep tabs on what's important.
- **Scope**: Transforming complex websites into widgets that help you find what you need. Watch for price changes, check for open campground spaces, and get updates on the latest traffic situation.

## High-Level Architecture

The Glanceables project is designed to streamline the browsing experience on macOS by allowing users to save and interact with specific portions of webpages. The architecture is composed of several key components that interact through a central ContentView, facilitating a modular and scalable system.

1. **ContentView**:

   - Acts as the main interface where users interact with the application. It integrates various views and handles the navigation between different parts of the application. Holds the dashboard, webclip menu, and notifications manager. 

2. **Web Capture System**:

   - Utilizes WebView to capture screenshots of webpages or specific areas defined by the user. This system is responsible for the real-time rendering and capture of web content.

3. **Local Storage**:

   - Saves the captured screenshots and webpage data locally. This allows users to access and manage their saved content offline and enhances the application's performance by reducing load times.

4. **Notification System**:

   - Integrates with macOS desktop notifications to alert users about updates or changes in their saved web content. This system helps in keeping the user informed without needing to actively check the app.

5. **Ollama Integration**:
   - Connects to Ollama for secure, private integration with an open-source LLM (large language model). This feature allows users to perform enhanced text analysis and other AI-driven tasks directly within the application.

## Directory Structure

- **Root Folders**:
  - `/View`: Contains all UI components.
  - `/ViewModel`: Handles the business logic associated with views.
